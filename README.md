### Information architecture

Information is stored primarily as FHIR resources.
Data model is described in [ODA RFC repository](https://github.com/omahoito/rfc/blob/master/README.md).

ODA uses standardized codesets whenever possible. See full [codes and code systems listing](codesets.md).

### Integrations
